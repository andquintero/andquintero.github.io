- title: "Single-cell transcriptomic analyses provide insights into the developmental origins of neuroblastoma"
  image: 2021_Jansky.png
  description: Neuroblastoma is a pediatric tumor of the developing sympathetic nervous system. However, the cellular origin of neuroblastoma has yet to be defined. Here we studied the single-cell transcriptomes of neuroblastomas and normal human developing adrenal glands at various stages of embryonic and fetal development. We defined normal differentiation trajectories from Schwann cell precursors over intermediate states to neuroblasts or chromaffin cells and showed that neuroblastomas transcriptionally resemble normal fetal adrenal neuroblasts. Importantly, neuroblastomas with varying clinical phenotypes matched different temporal states along normal neuroblast differentiation trajectories, with the degree of differentiation corresponding to clinical prognosis. Our work highlights the roles of oncogenic MYCN and loss of TFAP2B in blocking differentiation and may provide the basis for designing therapeutic interventions to overcome differentiation blocks.

- title: "Identifying multimodal signatures underlying the somatic comorbidity of psychosis: the COMMITMENT roadmap"
  image: dummy.png
  description: Schizophrenia carries an excess mortality of over 10 years that is largely due to somatic comorbidity with disorders including type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular diseases (CVD). With metabolic abnormalities found in medication-naïve and first-episode patients, and an increased type 2 diabetes risk in relatives of individuals with schizophrenia, there is substantial evidence that the elevated prevalence of type 2 diabetes in schizophrenia is a partially treatment-independent comorbidity. Individuals with schizophrenia also show a 50% increased risk of dying from CVD compared to the general population, which accounts for even more premature deaths. Besides an unhealthy lifestyle, the CVD incidence is attributed to risk factors believed to be comorbid with schizophrenia, and genetics studies suggest an underlying pleiotropy that supports shared mechanistic effects between both conditions. As patients are treated largely by a “one-fits-all” approach, there is a strong need to identify biological means to stratify patients and characterize the biological basis of somatic comorbidity. This will allow improved clinical delineation of psychoses and facilitate novel intervention strategies targeted at the minimization of comorbidity risk, reducing mortality and morbidity.

- title: "Super enhancers define regulatory subtypes and cell identity in neuroblastoma"
  image: 2021_Gartlgruber.png
  description: Using genome-wide H3K27ac profiles across 60 NBs, we identified four major super-enhancer-driven epigenetic subtypes and their underlying master regulatory networks. Three of these subtypes recapitulated known clinical groups, while the fourth subtype, exhibiting mesenchymal characteristics, ressemblance to Schwann cell precursors, was induced by RAS activation and was enriched in relapsed disease. This study reveals subtype-specific super-enhancer regulation in NBs.

- title: "ShinyButchR: Interactive NMF-based decomposition workflow of genome-scale datasets"
  image: 2020_Quintero.png
  description: Non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) has been widely used for the analysis of genomic data to perform feature extraction and signature identification due to the interpretability of the decomposed signatures. However, running a basic NMF analysis requires the installation of multiple tools and dependencies, along with a steep learning curve and computing time. To mitigate such obstacles, we developed ShinyButchR, a novel R/Shiny application that provides a complete NMF-based analysis workflow, allowing the user to perform matrix decomposition using NMF, feature extraction, interactive visualization, relevant signature identification, and association to biological and clinical variables. ShinyButchR builds upon the also novel R package ButchR, which provides new TensorFlow solvers for algorithms of the NMF family, functions for downstream analysis, a rational method to determine the optimal factorization rank and a novel feature selection strategy.

- title: "Deconvolution of single-cell multi-omics layers reveals regulatory heterogeneity"
  image: 2019_Liu.png
  description: Integrative analysis of multi-omics layers at single cell level is critical for accurate dissection of cell-to-cell variation within certain cell populations. Here we report scCAT-seq, a technique for simultaneously assaying chromatin accessibility and the transcriptome within the same single cell. We show that the combined single cell signatures enable accurate construction of regulatory relationships between cis-regulatory elements and the target genes at single-cell resolution, providing a new dimension of features that helps direct discovery of regulatory patterns specific to distinct cell identities. Moreover, we generate the first single cell integrated map of chromatin accessibility and transcriptome in early embryos and demonstrate the robustness of scCAT-seq in the precise dissection of master transcription factors in cells of distinct states. The ability to obtain these two layers of omics data will help provide more accurate definitions of “single cell state” and enable the deconvolution of regulatory heterogeneity from complex cell populations.
